BEER MONEY is a hand drawn (scribble) font with language extentions and some 
funny features 

Latin1 
Latin2 Eastern European 
Cyrillic 
Turkish 
Windows Baltic 

and correction signs in the place of "greater" and "less" , try it! :) 
typing glyph "greater" 1 time makes a cross over back to the previously written small word, 2 or 3 times makes it longer according to the length of the word you want to correct in the traditional way 
typing glyph "less" places a scribble, 2 times ">" makes a pipe. 
typing the word "nummer" makes a No. sign. 


This font is free for personal and commercial use , but I accept SMALL DONATIONS if you think itâ€™s worth a BEER! 
As I am not doing it for a living I am just a factory worker so I would respect that a lot! I hope one day I can buy a six pack from this work ;) 

I am using it for my comic strips, and its website! feel free to check it out :

I would also appreciate feedbacks or kerning help mostly in case of cyrillic issues may occure. 

I hope you enjoy this font! 

Cheers!
