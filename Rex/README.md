[Rex](http://www.fontfabric.com/rex-free-font/) is a font family with three weights – light, bold and bold inline – that was designed to create unique titles on the fly. It’s all caps font, but there is a difference between both – caps & small caps (see in the examples). Applicable for any type of graphic design – web, print, motion graphics etc and perfect for t-shirts and other items like posters, logos. Cyrillic version is included. Have fun!
Available for both – personal and commercial purpose (read the EULA). Thank you!
